# CosmoSim Documentation

This directory contains all project documentation, development artifacts, and planning materials.

## Structure

### `/architecture/`
Technical architecture and design documentation:
- `ENVIRONMENT_ENGINE.md` - Environment system architecture

### `/education/`
Educational simulation system documentation:
- `education_module.md` - Module specifications
- `education_module_roadmap.md` - Development roadmap

### `/implementation_plans/`
Technical plans for major features before implementation:
- `ps2.1_topology_aware_distance.md` - Topology-aware distance API
- `codebase_cleanup.md` - Codebase reorganization plan

### `/tasks/`
Task checklists tracking development progress:
- `ps2.1_topology_aware_distance.md` - PS2.1 progress tracking

### `/walkthroughs/`
Completed feature documentation with verification results:
- `physics_topology_aware_ps2.1.md` - PS2.1 completion walkthrough
- `physics_stabilization_ps1.1_ps1.2.md` - Physics stabilization phases
- `physics_stabilization_ps1.5_auto_camera.md` - Auto-camera system
- `topology_overlay_implementation.md` - Topology overlay
- `test_suite_updates.md` - Test organization

## Development Workflow

1. **Planning** → Create implementation plan in `/implementation_plans/`
2. **Execution** → Track progress in `/tasks/`
3. **Completion** → Document results in `/walkthroughs/`
